This project is an implementation of using the methods introduces in

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/304456863_Private_spatial_data_aggregation_in_the_local_setting

for parking in cities solution.

I implemented:
Algorithm 1 - 'local_randomizer()'
Algorithm 2 - 'server_pce()'
Algorithm 4 - 'pce_runner()'


for usage - install requirements and run experiments.py

have fun!
